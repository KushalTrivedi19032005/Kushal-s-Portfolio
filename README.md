Kushal's Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my first website, which is my personal portfolio, built using HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript.

Pages:
1. Home Page: Containing my role, number of unique visitors (using Leaflet.js), and a chatbot (whom I call Kwil!) to answer questions about me.
2. Experience Page
3. Research Page: Showing all of my existing research papers and technical reports.
4. Projects: List of technical projects I've built in the past.
5. Blogs: Showcases some of the articles I've written, which is my past-time.
